Purpose-engineered and built for real marine duty, M6 coaxial systems deliver maximum audio performance in any open-air boating environment.

The oversized 7.7-inch design of the M6-770X coaxial results in increased efficiency (more output for a given amount of power). Combine that advantage with long excursion and excellent power handling and you have a speaker system truly capable of playing loud and clear in a powerboat at speed.

A 1-inch pure silk dome tweeter, specially treated to withstand the marine environment, handles the high-frequency duties. You will appreciate the clean, articulate high-frequency response of the M6 dome tweeter, especially at higher volume levels.
