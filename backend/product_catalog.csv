The Altelix NF141208 NEMA 4X Weatherproof Enclosure is ideal for protecting equipment from harsh environments and tampering. This rugged NEMA box is molded from durable and UV resistant fiberglass reinforced polyester (FRP) with a UL94-5V flame rating. It features a gasketed door with stainless steel continuous hinge and stainless steel quick release latches with padlock hasps. The generous size of this enclosure and the extended lid accommodate a wide range of equipment.

This JIC style enclosure is dent-proof, corrosion resistant and UV stable. The FRP material is non-conductive and RF transparent. It is suitable for use in the harshest outdoor environments. It can be drilled and modified by the installer to suit unique site requirements.

Purpose-engineered and built for real marine duty, M6 coaxial systems deliver maximum audio performance in any open-air boating environment.

The oversized 7.7-inch design of the M6-770X coaxial results in increased efficiency (more output for a given amount of power). Combine that advantage with long excursion and excellent power handling and you have a speaker system truly capable of playing loud and clear in a powerboat at speed.

A 1-inch pure silk dome tweeter, specially treated to withstand the marine environment, handles the high-frequency duties. You will appreciate the clean, articulate high-frequency response of the M6 dome tweeter, especially at higher volume levels.

A multi-order, true 2-way passive crossover is concealed within the woofer chassis, shielded from vibration and corrosion",Final,0.75,519.99,549.99,519.99

The same principle that makes our 7.7-inch marine speakers dominate over conventional 6.5-inch designs is delivered in a more powerful dose in our M6-880X 8.8-inch coaxials.

These 8.8-inch diameter monsters offer significant performance advantages over our 7.7 inch models, and a huge advantage over conventional 6.5 inch marine coaxials. Thanks to 36% more cone area and almost double the excursion capability, the M6-880X's are capable of +6 dB greater low frequency output than our M6-770X 7.7-inch coaxial systems!

A true three-way loudspeaker design, the SCR-2115 employs the same sophisticated coaxial compression driver and horn found in the larger SCR-2215sm. Combining two subsystems in one, each driver is optimized for its performance across a narrower frequency range.  As such, power handling and dynamic range are increased while providing extended bandwidth.  The result is an effortless presentation of vocals and instrumentation with unrivaled detail; all delivered with the dynamics that give motion picture soundtracks and music a believable sense of scale.

The low frequency duties of the SCR-2115sm are performed by a single professional-grade 15-inch woofer supported by dual ports and powered by a massive motor system weighing nearly 30-pounds",Final,1,,,

A derivative of the SCRS-12ai design, the SCRS-212ai utilizes a second matching enclosure employing only the 12-inch woofer found in the main speaker. When mated to the SCRS-12ai, the two enclosures form a powerful dual 12-inch woofer loudspeaker system with low-frequency sensitivity of 96dB and an impressive total power handling spec of 2800 watts.

The new design was achieved by modifying the position of the drivers in the SCRS-12ai to justify the woofer to the top of the enclosure.

Use this product in projects where a Sonance 8 Ohm speaker is desired but the system is comprised of other 70V/100V speakers on a 70V/100V amplifier. These system configurations are typical of applications where many speakers are connected to a single amplifier for coverage in large areas or where speaker placement is over a great distance, requiring long speaker wire runs. 70 volt systems are great for commercial applications such as restaurants, hospitality, and amusement parks but are also frequently used in residential outdoor applications.
